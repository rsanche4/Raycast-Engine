 A very simple Raycasting Engine made in Java! 
 
 Here is are videos that shows a quick demo of what the engine can accomplish.

 There are comments through out the code explaining what each part does. Contact me for any questions!
 
 The engine allows you to change different worlds textures and cycle through each texture as well as change other things by pressing the numbers 0-9 on your keyboard!
 1 - Generate new seed, thus changing the world
 2 - Change Running Speed
 3 - Change rotation speed
 4 - Change Distance Fog
 5 - Change resolution
 6 - Cycle through textures for the floor
 7 - Cycle through textures for the ceiling/skybox
 8 - If skybox enabled, then make it move from side to side
 9 - Change the color of the distance fog (increase decimal color representation)
 0 - Change the color of the distance fog (decrease decimal color representation)
 
**Note:
There were other things I wanted to finish, like more world generations, but I decided to move on to other projects because it was taking too much time. Enjoy!
