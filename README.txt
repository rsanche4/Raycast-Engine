Work in Progress.

TODO:
- optimize the engine so it runs smooth as heck
- multiple-direction sprite. So when u look from an angle its different
- event data, scripting
- hud capabilities so we can add pictures on top, but honestly i get the feeling that's scripting thing (u pass the pixel to it and now scripts can do whatever with it)
