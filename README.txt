TODO:
- We have to figure out the sprite scripting situation



Games I plan to make for the future:

+ The Museum of Babel: Rooms expanding with all possible combinations of 64x64 images.

+ Lumiworld: A multiplayer game featuring Lumiworld.

+ Yume Nikki 3D: Yume Nikki remade in 3D.

+ Pacman 3D: Pacman remade in 3D.

+ Slenderman: Slenderman, horror game remade in the engine.

+ Oniyagi: Escape the goat demon with high school girl outfit coming after you as you do puzzles like Ao Oni.

+ The Backrooms Archive: The entire backrooms levels and wiki exposed here in all levels.

+ Girl and Zombies: Shooter game arcade like Left for Dead.

+ Underworld: AI simulation world game. See AIs interact with each other.

+ Afterlife: A visual novel generator game with NPCs, resembling the Angel beats setting.




- This read me will become a .md and it will have pictures, screenshots, tutorials on how to use the engine, etc. Along with maybe possible improvements. This document will be kept up to date.
