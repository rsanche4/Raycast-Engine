Upcming in future:
Here are descriptions for your projects:

The Babel Library
Enter a vast, procedurally generated library inspired by Borges' The Library of Babel. Navigate infinite hexagonal chambers filled with books containing every possible combination of letters. Uncover profound or nonsensical texts, and seek meaning in the chaos. Though I think we should adapt it to visual stuff. a 64 by 64 grid with all the colors. Images is way better. The question do we want the Canvas or the Museum. I think we problably want a canvas. But that's not as fun. Having rows upon rows of pictures maybe would be a really cool idea, and i feel like it would be amazing. Just 1 Canvas feels weird. I feel it will be better as maybe rooms. But yeah we want pictures. it's a gallery actually. With a long hallway, so design the building, and the exits. And maybe ask the person, is there a specific image youd like to see... or is location? etc.
