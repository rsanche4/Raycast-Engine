# Raycast Engine

Welcome to the **Raycast Engine**! This project is a lightweight and simple 3D rendering engine built around the concept of raycasting, which simulates the way light travels and interacts with objects in a 3D environment.

The Raycast Engine is typically used in first-person perspective games or simulations and can render walls, floors, and ceilings, creating the illusion of a 3D world on a 2D screen. Despite its simplicity, this engine allows for the creation of dynamic and immersive experiences with basic 3D elements like textures, lighting effects, and object placement.

Let me show you a quick demo!

Anyways, good luck and raycast away!
