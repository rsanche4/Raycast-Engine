# Raycast Engine

Welcome to the **Raycast Engine**! This project is a lightweight and simple 3D rendering engine built around the concept of raycasting, which simulates the way light travels and interacts with objects in a 3D environment.

The Raycast Engine is typically used in first-person perspective games or simulations and can render walls, floors, and ceilings, creating the illusion of a 3D world on a 2D screen. Despite its simplicity, this engine allows for the creation of dynamic and immersive experiences with basic 3D elements like textures, lighting effects, and object placement.

Let me show you a quick demo of the famous liminal myth The Backrooms rendered in this engine.

This is only a quick and simple project showcasing all the cool things you can accomplish! Anyways, good luck and raycast away!

Notes: The docs have not been written yet. I will write them once I find some time. As a quick summary, this is a java applic so make sure you have java installed. There are classes for the engine but the primary one is Screen.java. That contains different functions and these functions interact with your LUA scripts, which are read by the engine at run time. The Editor folder has the front end that allows you to edit maps etc. A sample project has been included so just run right away!
