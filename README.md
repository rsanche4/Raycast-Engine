# Raycast Engine

Welcome to the **Raycast Engine**! This project is a lightweight and simple 3D rendering engine built around the concept of raycasting, which simulates the way light travels and interacts with objects in a 3D environment.

The Raycast Engine is typically used in first-person perspective games or simulations and can render walls, floors, and ceilings, creating the illusion of a 3D world on a 2D screen. Despite its simplicity, this engine allows for the creation of dynamic and immersive experiences with basic 3D elements like textures, lighting effects, and object placement. Please note, this is classic raycasting.

Let me show you a quick demo!
