# Raycast Engine

Welcome to the **Raycast Engine**! This project is a lightweight (CPU Only) and simple 3D rendering engine using basic libraries only and built around the concept of raycasting, which simulates the way light travels and interacts with objects in a 3D environment.

The Raycast Engine is typically used in first-person perspective games or simulations and can render walls, floors, and ceilings, creating the illusion of a 3D world on a 2D screen. Despite its simplicity, this engine allows for the creation of dynamic and immersive experiences with basic 3D elements like textures, lighting effects, and object placement. There is a LOT to uncover in this engine as there is a big API that allows for all sorts of control, giving the users a lot of creative freedom! Please note, this is classic raycasting, not raytracing. If you are interested in more advanced 3D graphics, I would recommend learning OpenGL etc. This engine was mainly created for educational purposes!

Let me show you a quick demo of the famous liminal space "The Backrooms" rendered in this engine.

Note: there is currently the arcade game Dead Shot Girl full source code in the src folder under data. This shows how to use the engine for a shooter arcade type game!
