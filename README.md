# Raycast Engine

Welcome to the **Raycast Engine**! This project is a lightweight and simple 3D rendering engine using basic libraries (with GPU Support!) built around the concept of raycasting, which simulates the way light travels and interacts with objects in a 3D environment.

The Raycast Engine is typically used in first-person perspective games or simulations and can render walls, floors, and ceilings, creating the illusion of a 3D world on a 2D screen. Despite its simplicity, this engine allows for the creation of dynamic and immersive experiences with basic 3D elements like textures, lighting effects, and object placement. There is a LOT to uncover in this engine as there is a big API that allows for all sorts of control, giving the users a lot of creative freedom! Please note, this is classic raycasting, not raytracing. If you are interested in more advanced 3D graphics, I would recommend learning OpenGL etc.

Let me show you a quick demo!
