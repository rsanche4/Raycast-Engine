 This game is unfinished, and I this project might remain unfinished. Regardless, it was a fun experience designing the UI, and the gun animations.
 This is what it looks like:

Thanks for checking it out!

Notes on things I would like to implement for the future:
+ Have blood on screen as health goes down

+ Different ammo packs in the world can be picked up and used only temporary before switching back to main gun

+ Item in the world makes you move faster (timed though so its limited)

+ When reaching a certain score Convo, show on screen you made it to 200 points!

+ Used sound a lot. Sound when zombies die. Sound when we reload we shoot. And also sound when director AI goes into panic mode or relax mode etc

+ Include 4 zombie types: 
female zombies (weakest zombies, but faster)
male zombies (stronger than females, but slower than them)
a Tank boss like zombie, (same pace as the male zombies, but with a lot of health, and causes lots of dmg) 
a zombie that has a bit more life and it's faster (faster than the females, but with their same health)

+ 5 newly generated maps: (textures selected from a select group)
Weird city map with planets on sky - Improve it a bit, combine already made maps
Town with houses and trees - Not Done
High school map - Not Done
Desert map with structures everywhere - Improve it a bit
Backrooms - Done

+ Director spawns the zombies:
several blocks away from the player

+ When shooting the enemy, it must be the middle

+ 3 gun types: The pistol default inf ammo, the bmachine gun, the shotgun

+ Banner at the bottom needs to have variables, need to fiture out how to represent numbers and text in world

+ for guns, lower their resolution so it dont feel too out of place with the game pixelated feel
